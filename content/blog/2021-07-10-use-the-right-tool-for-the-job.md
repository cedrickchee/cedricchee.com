_This serve as a reminder to future myself._

The issue I think we miss when people say:

> "why are you using [Big Data tools], a Bash script would be faster" or
> 
> "a startup your size don't need Kubernetes, Cloud Run (serverless) or Render (PaaS) is a better fit" or 
> 
> "why are you using NoSQL, just use SQL DB" or
> 
> "why choose microservice architecture when you should start with a monolith".

Today, I revisit this 2017 post, ["You Are Not Google"](http://archive.today/qBtec) by Bradfield School of Computer Science to remind myself.

The point of this post was to tell you to **think** and to actually **understand the problem** you 
are trying to solve. It's NOT the article intention to tell you to ignore any big tech products
and big tech ideas that come out.

<!-- Regarding Cloud services: don't discount the advantage of managed services and serverless paradigm. -->
