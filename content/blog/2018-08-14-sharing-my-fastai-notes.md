Hey folks. I hope your day is going well.

Today, I am excited to share my [**fast.ai "Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders" complete course notes**](https://cedrickchee.gitbook.io/knowledge/courses/fast.ai/deep-learning-part-2-cutting-edge-deep-learning-for-coders/2018-edition). This is my personal notes on the 2018 edition of fast.ai Deep Learning Part 2. The notes are mainly written text transcript of each video lesson and they are partially time-coded. Thanks to our fellow student, [Hiromi Suenaga](https://twitter.com/hiromi_suenaga) for manually (old-fashioned) transcribe the full set of videos.

Benefits of this:

- We can refer back to the transcripts without having to play the videos all the time.
- This will save us a ton of time and helping us learn more effectively.
  - The transcript files are extremely helpful for searching up contents quickly.
- For whom English is not their first language that a major impediment to understanding the content is the lack of written transcript or course notes.

If you are looking for the 2017 edition (Keras+TensorFlow version), the course notes are available as well [here](https://cedrickchee.gitbook.io/knowledge/courses/fast.ai/deep-learning-part-2-cutting-edge-deep-learning-for-coders/2017-edition).

Wait, there's even more in my knowledge base (wiki). But, currently, it's mostly for [fast.ai course notes](https://cedrickchee.gitbook.io/knowledge/courses/fast.ai/fast.ai).

_These notes will continue to be updated and improved as I continue to study and review the course._

Till next time, **happy learning!**
