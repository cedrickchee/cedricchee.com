Hi there, welcome to my website. This is my first blog post in my brand new website. So it begins.

This is the fifth time I'm writing this "Hello World" post.

## Fifth time?

Since I discovered blogging in 2007, I've set up several blogs on various topics. I used Google Blogspot for my first blog until 2009. Each blog had a short life span.

* 2007 to 2009: Google Blogspot
* 2007 to 2009: Windows Live Spaces (shut down)
* 2009 to 2009: WordPress.com
* 2009 to 2011: Posterous (shut down)
* 2011 to 2013: Tumblr

Unfortunately, these blogs were forsaken for a period of time.

## The plan

Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I try to blog regularly but I don't know for sure right now. I will re-design the site in the future. Right now, I don't have the time or the energy to do so.

## Current state of the website

I just open up access to my website and blog today. Things are pretty much still work in progress, so expect a rough ride. I am still ironing out the kinks. I will write about that in an upcoming post/posts.

So, that's it. Thank you for visiting my website.
