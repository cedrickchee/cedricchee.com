Have you ever ponder what is software engineering after all?
I did at the start of a new year.

Software engineering from my viewpoint is about:

We see great engineering as the reduction of complex things into simple things.
These initial complexities might include code, abstractions, systems, architecture or infrastructure.
We believe this approach, searching for simplicity in complex things, lies at the heart of problem solving.
