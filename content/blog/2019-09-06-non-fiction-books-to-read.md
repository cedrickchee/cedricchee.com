These non-fiction books are on my reading list for a very long time.

Before, I don't read books that much. But when I do, I want to read books that are worth reading.

## Software Development

- [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) - re-read and write summary.
- [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://aosabook.org)
- [Shape Up - Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) by Ryan Singer.

## Programming Language

- [The Rust Programming Language (TRPL) book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - currently re-reading chapter 15.
- [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/)
- [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) - plan to re-read (when SIMD and GC feature land?)

## Deep Learning

- fastai library v2 is currently (Sept 2019) in active development. Once it is done, [there will be a O'Reilly book](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v2-daily-code-walk-thrus/53839/58?u=cedric) about it:

[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527).
