I'm reading the recently published JPEG XL spec.

Brunsli lossless recompression system and FUIF responsive image is interesting.

So, I go on an exploration and learned a few things about JPEG XL.

- [Brunsli: Practical JPEG repacker](https://github.com/google/brunsli)
  - Brunsli is a lossless JPEG recompression system library.
  - Brunsli allows for a 22% decrease in file size while allowing the original JPEG to be recovered byte-by-byte.
  - GOOD NEWS: now part of JPEG XL draft
- JPEG XL
  - Brunsli has been specified as the lossless JPEG transport layer in the [Committee Draft of JPEG XL Image Coding System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03565).
  - Ready to power faster and more economical transfer and storage of photographs.
  - [Overview of JPEG XL](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/)
- ImageMagick
  - [ImageMagick adding support for JPEG XL](https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=36828)
  - ImageMagick is the most central "Swiss Army Knife" for imaging in the web ecosystem.
- [From ImageCon 2019: "JPEG XL: Next-Generation of Image Format for the Internet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYJf7kelYQQ) [video]
  - Presentation slides by Jon Sneyer: https://www.slideshare.net/cloudinarymarketing/imagecon-2019-jon-sneyer
  - Some context: JPEG XL is a combination of Cloudinary's [FUIF](https://cloudinary.com/blog/introducing_fuif_responsive_images_by_design) (successor of [FLIF](http://flif.info/)) and Google's [Pik](https://github.com/google/pik).
    - [Great HN discussion on FLIF](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22262422)
- Benchmark/comparison
  - [A simple comparison between AV1, BPG, WebP and Pik for use in image compression (in Japanese language)](https://qiita.com/fg11894).
    - Pik won it. JPEG XL is an improved from Pik.
- Demo
  - [Brunsli demo of JPEG XL lossless recompression .jpg â‡„ .jxl](https://google.github.io/brunsli/)
- Tools
  - [JPEGXL - JavaScript](http://libwebpjs.appspot.com/jpegxl/) - you can encode to JPEG XL here. They compiled C/C++ code to WebAssembly.

> We care for making the Internet faster.
>
> Future of image compression with utmost respect to our digital heritage.

**My take**: I consider Brunsli a very promising approach as the successor of JPEG standard.
