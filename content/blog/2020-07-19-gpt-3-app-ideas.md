Part of my [side project](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-bert-nlp), I've been researching and curating a list of NLP resources focused on BERT, GPT, Transformer networks, and more for over two years.

GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer) came from the [Transformer family](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2020/04/07/the-transformer-family.html).

This year OpenAI is back with new language model GPT-3 and is currently making wave around the Internet. It's interesting to see what creative app ideas are possible using a bigger GPT-3 model. Below are a few random selection of such apps:

## Code Generator

- [A web UI layout generator](https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457): You just describe any layout you want, and it generates the React JSX code for you.

## Generative Text

- [Learn From Anyone](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1284177056507613187): question-answering agent (teacher).
- [Emoji storytelling](https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2020/06/24/open-ai-alchemy-emoji-storytelling/): Understand emojis and use them to describe movies.
- [Test prompts](https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/1275453101768470530) and all the AI-generated text results for those prompts.
- [Turing test](http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html)
- [Generated tweets](https://twitter.com/an_open_mind/status/1284487376312709120)
