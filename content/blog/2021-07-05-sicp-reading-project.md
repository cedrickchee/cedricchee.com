My first encounter with the SICP book (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) was in 2018 through the ["Teach Yourself Computer Science" website](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

<!-- more -->

It is known as the Wizard Book in hacker culture according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).

Eli blogged about his [10 months experience working through the entire book](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/04/18/sicp-conclusion).

Kai Wu did a great job wrting about [why one should study SICP](https://archive.is/uTOol).

One of the impact after learning SICP is, you will understand [why you don't need looping constructs](https://www.lvguowei.me/post/sicp-goodness-looping/).

A few years later (2021), I've decided to study SICP seriously and do most of the exercises.

So I began my journey.

## Goals

I want to learn the principles of programming properly.

I never quite understood functional programming (FP). After all these years doing OOP (C#) and some FP in JavaScript,
I hope I can finally pick up a new programming paradigm such as FP.
