Some online resources that I found and are particularly useful in my journey re-learning Go programming since the mid of last year (2019), after the last time I touched Go programming in 2015.

There are many good Go programming courses and books. But over the years, my go-to have been "Learn Go with TDD" course and Effective Go book.

## Courses

- [Learn Go with test-driven development](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) by Chris James.
  - The methodology clicked well with me.
- [Ultimate Go study guide, with heavily documented code and programs analysis, all in 1 place](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go) by Hoanh An.
  - Good notes and code comments by the author who has completed [Ultimate Go](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/blob/master/topics/courses/go/README.md) training by Ardan Labs.
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) by Mark McGranaghan.
  - Crash course for the busy people.
  - A hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs.

### Best Practices

- ["Effective Go"](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) by the Go Authors.
- [Practical Go: Real world advice for writing maintainable Go programs](https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go/presentations/qcon-china.html) by Dave Cheney.
- ~~[Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout). It covers:~~
  - ~~Go code style guidelines and recommendations.~~
  - ~~Naming and organizing packages as well as other code structure recommendations.~~

I hope you find this useful as well. It goes without saying. YMMV.
