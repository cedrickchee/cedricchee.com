[HotOS XVIII](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/) program will be great! We will get to see and hear new ideas in Operating Systems research on June 1 2021. It's been a while for me. I think it will be good time to pause and take the chance to catch up and learn about how tech advances and new applications in OS research are shaping our computational infra. I don't know where I hear this quip, "Always bet on Linux". lol.

I think this would get me enjoying reading papers again (PDF published by SIGOps):
