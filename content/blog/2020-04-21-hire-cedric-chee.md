I'm Cedric Chee, a Senior Software Engineer and mentor with years of experience working on software systems and product engineering. I’ve been part of the larger tech community since 2006. I love building high quality products. I have experience working in startup environment and remote working. In my last role, I developed a full stack web application in JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I'm a big believer in building tech that serves real user needs without burning out the engineers creating it.

My specialties are **full stack web development** in JavaScript/Go and React, **backend development** in Go or Node.js, and **systems programming** in Go or Rust. I'm great at taking existing products and making them to be more maintainable and performant.

I'm looking for opportunity:
- to work on high-throughput platforms at scale
- to make an impact by being part of something big
- to be part of an organisation with plenty of opportunity for personal development
- to work with a team of competent, motivated and fun co-workers

If you’re looking for experienced talent to build products, I'd love to chat. I have a link at the end of this post to schedule a time, but first let me outline some requirements:

**Location:** Remote or in Singapore (remote preferred)

**Employment type:** Full-time employee

**Organization:** Engineering

Some topics I’ll want to discuss with you:

- What is the mission of this team?
- Where do you think I can do the most good?
- What problems will this team be tackling over the next 6 months?
- Am I replacing someone on the team or is the team growing?
- What is this team most proud of?
- What is the makeup of this team?
- What is your interview process like?
- What is your hiring timeline for this position?
- Which parts of the business will be most impacted if the world stays locked down, and what steps will the company take to adjust?
- How are customers responding to the pandemic and how does it impact your product roadmap?
- What part of your onboarding process has been the hardest to do virtually?

I have been on sabbatical learning new skills and reading good books. I'm looking for the right position and eager to explore opportunities.
