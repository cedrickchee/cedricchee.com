JavaScript has a number of predefined objects. In addition, you can create 
your own objects.

## Using [object initializers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Object_initializers)

It is sometimes referred to as creating objects with literal syntax.
It's one of easiest way to create an object by simply define the property and values inside curly braces.

```javascript
let product = {
  mfgCountry: 'Indonesia'
};
product.name = 'Surgical Mask';
product.category = 'medical';
```

## Using [Object class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

```javascript
let product = new Object(); // store an empty Object object in product.
product.name = 'Surgical Mask';
product.category = 'medical';
product.mfgCountry = 'Indonesia';
```

## Using [Object's create method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create)

```javascript
// Create a new object using an existing object as the prototype.
let product = Object.create({
  name: this.name,
  category: this.category,
  mfgCountry: 'Indonesia'
}, {
  name: { value: 'Surgical Mask' },
  category: { value: 'medical' },
});
```

## Using [Object.prototype.constructor function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor#Examples)

```javascript
function Product(name, category) {
  this.name = name;
  this.category = category;
  this.mfgCountry = 'Indonesia';
}
let product = new Product('Surgical Mask', 'medical');
console.log('product.constructor is ' + product.constructor);
```

## Using [ES6 Class syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

JavaScript classes are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing
prototype-based inheritance.

```javascript
class Product {
  constructor(name, category) {
    this.name = name;
    this.category = category;
    this.mfgCountry = 'Indonesia'
  }
}
let product = new Product('Surgical Mask', 'medical');
```

## Using Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

IIFE is a design pattern which is also known as a self-executing 
anonymous function.

```javascript
let product = new(function (name, category) {
  this.name = name;
  this.category = category;
  this.mfgCountry = 'Indonesia';
})('Surgical Mask', 'medical');
```

## Using Function constructor with prototype

_(Note: this is NOT one of the way to create a JavaScript object with the same behavior as the rest
of the examples in this post because it set the property on the prototype and not the object it self.)_

```javascript
function Product() {
  this.mfgCountry = 'Indonesia';
}
Product.prototype.name = 'Surgical Mask';
Product.prototype.category = 'medical';
let product = new Product();
```

I deliberately show this example because this is where a lot of confusion usually begins with JavaScript prototypes.
