I have been using RescueTime since 2016 and a "premium" customer from 2017. However, 2017 report is missing as I couldn't generate it from RescueTime website now.

## The Why

These reports are useful data for my monthly self retrospective session. By sharing this data publicly, I hope you can learn and get a sense about my productivity for my primary role as a software engineer.

Oh, I hope it's not too late to wish everyone, a happy and productive 2021!

That's all I have for today. Taa...
