A place to keep some of my Go programming flashback.

## Timeline

- Nov 2009: I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cedric_chee/status/5605171058) about Google releasing their own programming language, Go. ( while I was learning Ruby on Rails :D )

- May 2013: I learned about some Golang early successes in production and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cedric_chee/status/337967641052454912) it.

- Oct 2014: I attended the GoSG meetup for the first time and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cedric_chee/status/522032532930306049) about it.

- My first serious (and fun) foray into Go programming dated back to Sept 2015. I remember I was using version 1.5.1 for some weekend hacks (hobby projects).
