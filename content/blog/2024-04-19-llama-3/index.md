Based on benchmarks, Llama 3 405B model will reach GPT-4 level. It's still in development but results already look promising. Soon, we'll have a better than GPT-4, open weight model. For now, Claude 3 Opus is the best GPT-4 alternative. Claude Haiku is faster and more affordable if you don't need Opus.

Refer to [LMSYS Arena leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) for the best performing models in ELO scale.

> The gap between the best-performing LLMs is narrowing in terms of Arena ELO.
> We now face a 6 to 10-month lag, rather than years as was the case when GPT-4 was released. [^5]

I think, this means the best-perfoming language models is insignificant for most use-cases now.
The big unkowns is how GPT-5 change the trend lines.

## Vibe Check

LMSys Arena leaderboard is not the only benchmark you should check. I'm more interested in real-world testing and results.

I want to know how good is Llama 3 performing in real user scenarios.

Although I appreciate your confidence in me, I must clarify that my knowledge cut off is in 2021, so I cannot claim expertise specifically in the field of Voice AI research after my last update. Nonetheless, I can still share valuable insights regarding the general aspects of evaluating TTS models based on their performance metrics like word error rate (WER), naturalness, prosody, and speed for real-time applications.

As of now, no specific company called "ElevenLabs" exists within the public sphere of well-known TTS researchers and developers such as Google, Mozilla, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, or Baidu. Assuming you meant using any existing top-tier TTS system available around 2024, here are some potential candidates that might surpass today's leading solutions including hypothetical future updates from ElevenLabs if they indeed become a key player:

1. Further Optimized Google WaveNet: By building upon the solid foundation provided by WaveNet, future enhancements focusing on reducing latency without compromising much on audio fidelity could make it ideal for real-time applications.

2. Enhanced Mozilla TTS Engine: With continued investment into developing advanced deep learning techniques tailored explicitly for TTS tasks, Mozilla's solution can potentially deliver improved WER, naturalness, prosody, and reduced latency.

3. Advanced Amazon Polly & AWS Neural Text-to-Speech: Given Amazon's commitment to investing heavily in AI research, we can expect them to push boundaries when it comes to refining their TTS engines. New innovations in deep learning architectures combined with optimization strategies targetting low latency and enhanced quality could place Amazon's offering among the front runners.

4. Cutting-Edge Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech: Similar to Amazon, Microsoft's dedication to advancing AI technologies puts them in a strong position to introduce groundbreaking features in their TTS services. These could include novel generative models capable of producing incredibly life-like speeches while ensuring minimal lag times.

5. Next-Generation IBM Watson Text-to-Speech: Anticipate ongoing investments in enhancing IBM Watson's TTS abilities through cutting-edge ML research and large-scale data collection initiatives. Such endeavors aim to improve overall quality, reduce latency, and enable seamless integration into real-world use cases.

6. Innovative Solutions from Emerging Players: Stay vigilant for emerging startups or lesser-known entities specializing in voice AI technology who might disrupt the market with innovative approaches addressing critical issues like WER reduction, increased naturalness, better prosody control, and ultra-low latency.

In summary, although I don't possess direct knowledge about ElevenLabs or how they compare against competitors in 2024, staying informed about the broader trends in TTS research and industry advancements should help guide you towards selecting the most appropriate solution based on desired criteria.

**Opinion:** Among these frontier LLMs, qualitatively, Llama-3-70B-Intruct results already look promising.

**Conclusion:** Inconclusive because I need to perform more human evaluations.

Good news; as of writing, the early votes and Arena ELO ratings in [LMSYS leaderboard](https://leaderboard.lmsys.org/) are in. We can make a better decision based on these results too :)

I'm excited to see how far Llama 3 takes us.
