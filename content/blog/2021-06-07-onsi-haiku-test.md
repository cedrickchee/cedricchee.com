I asked a CTO what is their north stars when it comes to running code on the Cloud. They said, it's the Onsi Haiku Test:

Onsi Haiku Test, is a haiku that Onsi Fakhouri shared at a conference:

> Here is my source code.
> 
> Run it on the Cloud for me.

> I do not care how.

The Turing Test for Cloud computing?

[The spectrum of Cloud deployment technologies](https://thenewstack.io/defining-spectrum-cloud-deployment-technologies/):

> There are numerous cloud deployment technologies available today.

> Whether you prefer the familiarity of a VM, the agility of a Docker

Where are we right now and how are we doing?
In my opinion as an application developer, Cloud technologies should 
focus on making it easy to run code.
