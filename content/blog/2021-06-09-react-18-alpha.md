Hey!

Today, the React team share ["The Plan for React 18"](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html).

React 18 is coming and I want to take this chance and compile some stuffs for exploring new feature like Suspense and many more.

1. Cassidy Williams whipped out a [blog post pointing out what you should know now, and what's coming soon](https://d1ev.to/cassidoo/react-18-alpha-is-out-now-what-2apj). It's a good run down of the features.

**tl;dr**

> React core maintainers kept us in Suspense long enough. But now React developers have some new features to play with.
>
> The best part: Almost all of the benefits of the upgrade don't require major code changes.

2. [Introducing React 18](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4)

**tl;dr**

These updates should simplify the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) story and make frameworks like Next.js even better.

3. Dan Abramov wrote about the ["New Suspense SSR Architecture in React 18"](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37). It's a longread. It describes the new SSR architecture that Sebastian Markb√•ge and their team have been working on. This post is friendly for developers of all levels: Dan patiently walks us through the concepts of SSR, Suspense, lazy loading, and hydration. (nice touch on the visuals)

4. Another good run down/summary of the featues by [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1402323429643018242)

The (SSR) suspense is over. ^_^
