# Backend Software Engineer {#manual .header .no-anchor}

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cedric Chee. I've been a [software engineer](https://github.com/cedrickchee), writer,
and [entrepreneur](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cedricchee_today-we-are-crossing-the-finishing-line-activity-6517235249297096704-9wo8).

I code and write about it sometimes. I create system softwares and apps in [**Go**](https://github.com/cedrickchee?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=go&sort=stargazers)/[**JS**](https://github.com/cedrickchee?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=javascript&sort=stargazers).

I do product engineering and web development at startups/consulting. I enjoy **backend development**.

I'm currenly focusing on [**Large Language Models (LLMs)**](/tags/llm/). I tinker with LLMs and [AI](/tags/ai/) systems at night.
